Notes: PowerShell runtime test

Created test script:
c:\Users\a1kay\Desktop\a1 a1\project\scripts\check-powershell.ps1

To run:
- In PowerShell (recommended): 
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "c:\Users\a1kay\Desktop\a1 a1\project\scripts\check-powershell.ps1"

- Or open the script in VS Code and run (F5) or run the file in the integrated terminal.

The script prints version, execution policy, runs a sample command and returns exit code 0 on success.
