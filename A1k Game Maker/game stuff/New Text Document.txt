ext Steps / Follow-ups
Portal Playtest: trigger the training portal to ensure boss spawn/death loop and cooldown UI behave in long sessions.
Boss Balance Tuning: adjust TRAINING_BOSS_FALLBACKS stats/drops once real BossPool data sources finalized.
Act Button Tooltips: add mini HUD instructions so new mappings (Act vs Act2) are obvious for players.
UI polish: animate Act buttons when they switch modes or are disabled due to cooldowns.
NPC Dialog Enhancements: auto-focus first dialogue option when opened via Act2 for faster hiring.
5 Quick Implementations (1–5 min each)
Add toast when Act2 is disabled explaining “Move closer to an NPC to talk/hire.”
Display portal cooldown timer bar near Act button instead of text label.
Add sound effect hook when training boss spawns (reuse existing AudioSystem.playSound).
Expose pressAct() keyboard binding for accessibility (bind to Q).
Log recent Act button actions to Logs tab for QA.
Token / LOC Options
Option 1: 1–2K tokens, ~120 LOC – simply finalize portal boss testing harness & logging.

Option 3: 20K+ tokens, 800–1.2K LOC – full portal raid loop (multi-wave, co-op AI allies, reward treasury UI). Max budget <5M tokens per earlier constraint.
