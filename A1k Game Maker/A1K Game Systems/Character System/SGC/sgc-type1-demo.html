            <h2>📖 About This Style</h2>
            <p>
                HD Pixel Art represents the pinnacle of hand-crafted pixel art aesthetics, combining the nostalgia of
                8-bit/16-bit era with modern high-density pixel placement and expressive animation. Each sprite is built with
                pixel-perfect precision, featuring selective contrast for facial features, color ramping for material depth, and subpixel
                rim-lighting for weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                This style is perfect for Action RPGs, roguelikes, and side-scrollers that need cinematic flair without
                sacrificing the charm of traditional pixel art.
